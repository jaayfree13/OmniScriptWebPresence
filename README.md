I am a software engineer with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Animation from the Univiersity of Utah. 
My main interests are in web development and programming creative applications. I really enjoy brainstorming 
ideas and being able to create a prototpye which builds upon itself to become a full fledged creation. As for 
languages, react has been fantastic to learn and use! However, when I need to code something that's not a website,
I like to use C# and C++. I am a highly motivated person with aspirations to create great things and believe 
technology is the perfect catalysty to get things moving. With a bit of innovation, artistic vision, and 
problem-solving, anything is achievable!\

I am a Computer Science major at the University of Utah. My interests range from Networks to Security, with my 
favorite topic being Database Design. I have experience in full stack development, with preferences to backend processes, 
including data storage and algorithm design. I prefer to use high level languages such as C# and Java, as I have strong 
abilities in object-oriented programming. Outside of the tech field, I have interests in the natural sciences, specifically 
biology and chemistry. I hope to one day design my own video game from the ground up and have been independently learning 
how to 3D model and use game engines to create basic functionality.\

I am a (very soon to be) graduate with a B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah. I really enjoy solving
the interesting and dynamic problems you encounter during coding, and enjoy working in any object-oriented programming language. 
I am particularly proficient with C# and backend web development through .NET, or programming for games through the Unity engine, 
but I have experience in Java, C, C++, Python, and frontend styling or html work. Outside of my professional interests I have a 
passion for video games, and programming I do in my free time is primarily experiments in game making.\

# User Tutorial / How to use

## Using the Bookshelf

Start by creating a book or selecting one you've previously created. Once you have a book selected, you will see a sidebar 
appear on the left which allows you to navigate to other areas of the website to start creating. With a selected book, you can 
either right-click or press the 3 dots in the top right of that book to bring up an edit menu. From here you have the options of 
renaming the book, changing the description, or deleting it along with all of the book contents.


## Creating Items

On any of the item pages (which are the Characters, Groups, Events, Places, and Concepts icon on the sidebar) you're greeted 
with  an area to make a new item. Click the add button in the bottom right and give your item a name! When the item is selected, 
you will have an additional menu pop up to the right with the home section highlighted. To add in a description about the item, 
click the edit button in the bottom right which will bring up a text editor that allows you write whatever information you want. 
When you're done writing just hit save.


## Making Relations
 
Relationships between items make for easy navigation across the website. This should be utilized for items in which there is
some connection between the two, So that a quick reference can be made. To make a relation click on one of the item menus 
associated sections. EX:Characters to make a relationship with a character. This will show all relationships that item has, and by
hovering over a relationship you can see the type of relation you defined. Clicking it will navigate you to that other item. However,
while editing (when the edit button is selected) you will see all items of that type both relationships and non-relationships. By 
selecting a non-relationship, an add button appears which allows a quick  relation to be made. On the other hand, selecting an 
existing relation displays a delete and rename button. Note: Making a relationship is now 2-way  so you will have to go define a 
relation on the other item if you want such a thing.


## The Attribute List

On the home section for an item, you may notice the attribute list. Attributes are reusable info points you can use across 
all items. Simple enter  edit mode and click Edit Attribute Groups to get started. From here you will get a menu with all attributes 
groups on the left and all associated attributes on the right. On the left side, you can create, select, rename, or delete a group. 
If you have one selected, then on the right you can do the same things for attributes. Remember these are created for an entire book, 
so all items share these same attribute groups and attributes. To populate a specific item, check  the checkbox of the attribute and 
provide a value to be placed in the table. You can select as many or as little attributes to give an item. At any point you can remove
an attribute from the table by deselecting the checkbox. To edit the value of an attribute, enter edit mode on the home section and you
will see the value box turn purple. From there just type in the updated information.


## Writing in the Text Editor

Our text editor provides various components which are very important to understand. The one thing that makes this particular text
editor stand out is that whenever an item's name is mentioned, that text will be high-lighted purple in the editor. When clicked, 
information about that item will be shown on the page next tothe editor. Similarly, the @ symbol in our text editor is very important. 
This symbol will pull up a menu containing all of the names of the items created in the book. The editor also supports key-binds, such 
as ctrl+b to bold text, ctrl + c to copy, etc. Everything written inside of the text editor MUST be saved manually, however, if you make 
changes to the text of a chapter and navigate to another chapter than it's contents are automatically saved and there is no need to 
manually save. A tool bar exists which allows users to undo, redo, bold text and more. A text editor side bar exists which allows users 
to create new chapters to their writings. Users can add chapters, remove chapters and swap the position of chapters by using the up and 
down arrows. Lastly,users can click on the dropdown menu to access the page contents which will show all headings inside of a page. When 
these headings are clicked the user will be instantly navigate to that content in the editor.


## Timelining Events

The timeline page is meant to help users visualize the sequence of events which occur within a story. To place an event onto the timeline,
a user must click on an event 
from the "Nontimeline events" side bar. With an event selected, a user can click on the timeline to anchor that event to the visualization. 
The user can than select the starting, or ending position of the event by clicking on the timeline a second time. When an event was anchored
to the timeline page, an indicator will  be shown on the timeline page as to what the event will look like when placed. Users can place as 
many events as needed. If the user has ran out of space on their timeline, they can click on right arrow button located directly below the 
timeline to move to a "future" position within the timeline. Users can click on the left arrow button to navigate "backwards" within a 
timeline, if a backwards timeline exists. Lastly, if users want to mark or denote segments of time with dates or phases of a writing, they can 
click on the "Add Label" button. The user will need to click on the timeline and enter the text they want that label to hold on the timeline.


## Event Groupings

An event grouping is meant to be a "marking" that is used to shown a relationship between multiple events. To create an event grouping 
you will click on the dropdown menu on the sidebar than click on the event groupings tab. Once the event groupings sidebar you can select a 
color and provide a title that describes the relationship between events on the timeline. With those two pieces of information defined, you 
can create a new event groups. Once you have event groups defined we can now assign them to events within the timeline. To assign an event 
group to a specific event, click on the circle on the desired event. A menu will open and will display the color of the event groupings. 
Click on the color you want to assign that group 
to the event.
